# Credit-Scoring-and-Segmentation-using-Python
This project demonstrates the process of calculating credit scores and segmenting customers based on their credit profiles. It is designed to help financial institutions assess the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses, enabling informed decisions about lending, interest rates, and credit limits.


Credit scoring involves evaluating various factors like payment history, credit utilization ratio, and employment status to determine a credit score for each individual. Customers are then segmented into distinct groups based on their credit scores to manage credit risk effectively.
